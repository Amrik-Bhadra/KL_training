jest.fn():
    --> create a mock function (also called a spy function)
    --> it does nothing by default
        --> records how many times it was called
        --> records with what arguments it was called
        --> records what the mock function returned

    --> You can then control its behavior by chaining helpers like:
        --> .mockReturnValue(value) → always returns that value (synchronous).
        --> .mockResolvedValue(value) → always returns a Promise.resolve(value).
        --> .mockRejectedValue(error) → always returns a Promise.reject(error).
